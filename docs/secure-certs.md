# Simple, Secure Setup for App Signing Certificates Using Visual Studio Online or Team Foundation Services 2015
When developing an app for iOS or Android either nativley or using a cross-platform solution like Cordova you will eventually need to tackle the problem of managing signing certificates and (in the case of iOS) [Mobile Provisiong Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppStoreDistributionTutorial/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013839). This article will highlight some features to help you manage and secure them for your app.

## iOS
### Challenges
For iOS there are a number of challenges associated with managing certificates and profiles particularly in a CI environment.

1. Generated signing certificates are *local to the machine you created them on*. Certificates generated via Xcode or via the Apple Developer portal are tied to a private key that is local to your machine.
2. There are limited number of certificates that can exist for a given type. If you have three machines that need to be able to sign your app, you ultimatley need to use the exact same cert on each machine.
3. By default, Xcode uses an auto-match proceedure to find both an approiate signing certificate and provisioning profile. This can be quite problematic in a CI environment where you likely want to use a very specific signing certificate and provisioning profile.
4. "Ad hoc" provisioning profiles typically used for beta distribution tie to the same "iPhone Distribution" certificate used for actual app store distribution. As a result, auto-matching using a "signing identity" does not work well when you need the same machine to generate an ipa of both types.
5. While you can reference a specific provisioning profile in Xcode itself, specifying the exact provisioning profile requires referencing a UUID contained within the file that is difficult to access. This limits your ability to have your CI configuration independant of the contents of your project.
6. There is no offical command to install a provisioning profile from the command line
7. The "default keychain" is typically locked when a process is not running interactivley. As a result, if you VSO agent is running as a daemon or launch agent you will be unable to use signing certificates installed on your machine. You can add a "Command Line" build step calling the appropriate "security" command to unlock the keychain but this requires you to specify the password in your build definition and prevents you from having different passwords on different servers.
8. Installing certificates in the default keychain makes them available to anyone with access to create build definitions by executing a "securty" command after unlocking the keychain
9. A commonly used trick to generate versions multiple signed versions of your app in the past has been to leverage the "PackageApplicaiton" script and pass in signing and provisioning profile embedding arguments. However, this script fails as of Xcode 6 (and still fails in 7.1 beta) unless you add something called a ResourceRule to your project. The issue is that this concept is deprecated and Apple has stated they will reject apps that use it that are published to the store.

Combined, this results in a bit of a nightmare. 

### Simplifying and Securing the Build Environment
To help alleviate these problems, the Xcode Build and Cordova Build tasks include some additional features designed to streamline this process. 

Here's the general process for setting things up:

1. After creating your development and/or distribution signing certificate, export it to a .p12 file using either Keychain Access or Xcode
  
  1. To export using Xcode, first go to Xcode > Prefereces... > Accounts and select your Apple Developer account
  
  2. Click "View Details..." and then right click on the Signing Identity you wish to export, and click "Export..."
  
  3. Enter a filename and password. Take note of the password as we will need this later.

  Alternativley you can follow a similar process using the "Keychain Access" app on OSX and using the Apple Developer portal to download your provisioning profile. Technically you can also generate a signing certificate on Windows. Use the proceedure [described in this article](http://docs.build.phonegap.com/en_US/signing_signing-ios.md.html#_windows_users) if you would prefer to follow these methods.

2. Next, get a copy of the provisioning profile you want to use 
  
  1. You can simply go to the Apple Developer portal and download your mobile provisioning profile from there but you can also use Xcode to get one installed on your machine.
  
  2. To get one from Xcode, first go to the same screen you used to get the .p12 file above 
  
  3. Next, right click the provisioning profile you want and select "Show in Finder"
  
  4. Copy the file highlighed to another location and it a descriptive filename

3. Next, for an added layer of security, you can quickly encrypt these two files from the command line. **If you'd rather not encrypt, you can skip this step and omit the "Decrypt" tasks described later.**

  1. Open the Terminal app on your Mac
  
  2. Change to the folder containing your .p12 file and .mobileprovision file.
  
  3. Type the following:
  
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    openssl des3 -in iphonedeveloper.p12 -out iphonedeveloper.p12.enc
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    ...substituting des3 for any encryption cypher you'd like to use and the appropriate input and output file names.
  
  4. Enter a passphrase to encrypt the certificate when prompted and note this down as we will use it later.
  
4. Next, add these two files to source control (the encrypted .p12 and .mobileprovision files). This is secure particiularly if you are using a private repository since a melicious user would need access to the repository, the encryption passphrase, and the P12 passphrase to be able to use your information without permission.

5. Now we'll set up our build definition to use these files in a secure way. 

  1. Open up your Xcode or Cordova build definition and go to the **Variables** tab. Here we will enter the following:
  
    1. **P12**: Path to your encrypted .p12 file in source control.
    2. **P12_PWD**: Password to the unencrypted .p12 file. *Be sure to click the "lock" icon.* This will secure your password and obscure it in all logs.
    3. **MOB_PROV**: Path to your encrypted mobile provisioning profile.
    4. **ENC_PWD**: The phassphrase you used to encrypt the .p12 and .mobileprovision files. If you used two different passwords you'll need two variables.  Again, *Be sure to click the "lock" icon.*

  2. Under the **Build** tab in your build definition, add two **Decrypt File (OpenSSL)** steps from the **Utility** category.
  
  3. Now, enter the proper information using the variables we created above to decrypt the two files to a static filename.
  
    1. **Cypher**: The cypher you specified while encrypting. (Ex: des3)
    2. **Encrypted File**: $(P12) for one step and $(MOB_PROV) for the other
    3. **Passphrase**: $(ENC_PWD)
    4. **Decrypted File Path**: _build.p12 for one step and _build.mobileprovision for the other

	![Decrypt File settings](media/secure-certs/secure-certs-4.png)
  
  4. Finally, we'll update our Xcode Build or Cordova Build step with references to these two files. The build step will automatically determine the correct "signing identity" based on the contents of the .p12, create a temporary keychain with the .p12 in it and use that exclusivley for this build, install the mobile provisioning profile, determine the correct UUID based on the contents of the .mobileprovision profile, and then clean everything up afterwards. Enterthe values under the **Signing & Provisioning** category for the Xcode Build task or the **iOS** category in the Cordova Build task. 
  
    1. **Override Using**: File Contents
    2. **P12 Certificate File**: _build.p12
    3. **P12 Password**: $(P12_PWD)
    4. **Provisioning Profile File**: _build.mobileprovision
    5. **Remove Profile After Build**: Checked if you want the mobileprovision profile to be removed from the system after the build. Only check this if you will have one agent on the system running this build as it is installed in a global location.

 You are now all set! Any build agent that is running will now be able to securly build your app without any cert managment on the build machine itself!!  Simply repeat the process of adding different certificates and provisioning profiles to your source repo to enable separate dev, beta (ad hoc), and distribution build.
