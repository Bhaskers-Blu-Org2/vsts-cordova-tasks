Visual Studio Team Services (formerly Visual Studio Online) and Team Foundation Services (TFS) 2015 can be used for building and testing Cordova apps in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment thanks to a new [cross-platform agent](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=533789) that supports OSX. This new agent enables you to use Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or TFS to build projects targeting Android, iOS, or Windows created using [Tools for Apache Cordova](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=536496) or *any Cordova compliant CLI like the Ionic, PhoneGap (local), or TACO CLI.* 

## Visual Studio Team Services Extension for Cordova

This extension contains a set of VS Team Services "tasks" (or "build steps") that streamline setup when building Cordova based applications in a CI environment. These tasks can be used with either VSTS or TFS 2015 on-prem servers (see below) and are intended to work with any Cordova based project including, but not limited to, those created using Tools for Apache Cordova. The tasks:
- Are designed to work with Cordova and Cordova-like toolsets like Ionic
- Automatically acquire and cache the appropriate version of Cordova or related CLI (ex: Ionic) based on task settings or the contents of taco.json
- Enable simplified signing, certificate management, and packaging particularly for iOS
- Include support for Tools for Apache Cordova specific features
- Support the Android, iOS, Windows, and Windows Phone 8.0 (wp8) Cordova platforms
	
## Quick Start

1. After installing the extension, upload your project to VSTS, TFS, or GitHub.
2. Go to your VSTS or TFS project, click on the **Build** tab, and create a new build definition (the "+" icon).
3. Click **Add build step...** and select **Cordova Build** from the **Build** category
4. Configure the build step - *Check out the tool tips for handy inline documentation.*
5. Add a **Demand** under the **General** tab of **xcode** to force the build to run on OSX or **cmd** to force it to run on Windows as appropriate

## Usage and Tutorials
