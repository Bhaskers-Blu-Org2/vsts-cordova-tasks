Visual Studio Online (VSO) and Team Foundation Services (TFS) 2015 can be used for building and testing Cordova apps in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment thanks to a new [cross-platform agent](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=533789) that supports OSX. This new agent enables you to use VSO or TFS to build projects targeting Android, iOS, or Windows created using [Tools for Apache Cordova](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=536496) or *any Cordova compliant CLI project like Ionic or the TACO CLI.* 

This repository contains a set of VSO "tasks" (or "build steps") that streamline setup when building Cordova based applications in a CI environment. These tasks can be used with either VSO or TFS 2015 on-prem server (see below for installation details) and are intended to work with any Cordova based project not just Tools for Apache Cordova. The tasks:

- Are designed to work with Cordova and Cordova-like toolsets like Ionic
- Automatically acquire and cache the appropriate version of Cordova or related CLI (ex: Ionic) based on task settings or the contents of taco.json
- Enable simplified signing, certificate management, and packaging particularly for iOS
- Include support for Tools for Apache Cordova specific features
- Support the Android, iOS, Windows, and Windows Phone 8.0 (wp8) Cordova platforms
	
## 5 Step Quick Start

1. After installing the extension, upload your project to Visual Studio Online, TFS, or GitHub.

2. Go to your Visual Studio Online or TFS project, click on the **Build** tab, and create a new build definition (the "+" icon).

3. Click **Add build step...** and select **Cordova Build** from the **Build** category

4. Configure the build step - *Check out the tool tips for handy inline documentation.*

5. Add a **Demand** under the **General** tab of **xcode** to force the build to run on OSX or **cmd** to force it to run on Windows as appropriate

## Usage and Tutorials
See the following articles on using these tasks in VSO/TFS:

1. [Cordova Build Task](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=691186)
	- [Securing Signing Certs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=691933)
2. [Cordova Command Task](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=692058)
3. [Ionic Command Task](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=692057)

To be implemented:

1. TACO CLI Command Task
2. PhoneGap CLI Command Task

There are gaps and known issues for most tasks. See [TODOs](./docs/TODO.md) for more information.

##Installation

### Visual Studio Online
1. Install the [Cordova Extension for Visual Studio Online](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=691188)
